  "description": "VERIFIED & STRENGTHENED: WebSocket integration is fully functional with bi-directional support (start, stop, input). Verified the fix for the 'mark_consumed' bug and confirmed that concurrent tasks and inputs work perfectly over a single connection. Extensive tests in tests/test_websocket.py, tests/test_ws_cleanup.py, and tests/test_ws_concurrency.py pass."
