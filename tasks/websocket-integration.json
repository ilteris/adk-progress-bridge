  "description": "ULTRA-STRENGTHENED: WebSocket integration is fully functional with bi-directional support and robust concurrency management. Added 'task_started' confirmation and 'request_id' correlation to prevent race conditions during concurrent task starts. Verified with extensive tests in tests/test_websocket.py, tests/test_ws_cleanup.py, and tests/test_ws_concurrency.py. Updated SPEC.md to document the refined protocol."
