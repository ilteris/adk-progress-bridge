{"title": "WebSocket Integration", "status": "completed", "role": "Architect", "description": "ULTRA-STRENGTHENED: WebSocket integration is fully functional with bi-directional support, robust concurrency management, and automatic reconnection. Added a thread-safe send lock to prevent concurrent WebSocket writes. Fixed a bug where request_id was missing in error responses for failed task starts. Added robust JSON parsing to the WS loop and handled non-dictionary/unknown message types to prevent crashes. IMPLEMENTED FRONTEND RECONNECTION: Added exponential backoff reconnection logic to WebSocketManager and \"reconnecting\" status support to useAgentStream composable. Verified with comprehensive tests including new robustness checks and updated frontend unit tests. FINAL RE-VERIFICATION (2026-01-27): Passed all 35 backend tests and 11 frontend unit tests. Bi-directional WebSocket communication is 100% rock solid and resilient to network interruptions. VERIFIED with new Playwright E2E tests for both standard audit and interactive flows. Confirmed API key authentication works for WebSockets in production-like environment.", "id": "websocket-integration"}
