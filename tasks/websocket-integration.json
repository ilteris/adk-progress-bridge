{"title": "WebSocket Integration", "status": "completed", "role": "Architect", "description": "Verified and refined the bi-directional WebSocket layer. Confirmed support for task cancellation, mid-execution interactive input, and REST fallback for SSE. Added Vitest test cases for interactive input flows. Modernized the backend by replacing deprecated @app.on_event handlers with the FastAPI lifespan pattern. All tests (Python and Vitest) are passing with zero warnings."}
