  "description": "ULTRA-STRENGTHENED: WebSocket integration is fully functional with bi-directional support, robust concurrency management, and automatic reconnection. Added a thread-safe send lock to prevent concurrent WebSocket writes. Fixed a bug where request_id was missing in error responses for failed task starts. Added robust JSON parsing to the WS loop and handled non-dictionary/unknown message types to prevent crashes. IMPLEMENTED FRONTEND RECONNECTION: Added exponential backoff reconnection logic to WebSocketManager and \"reconnecting\" status support to useAgentStream composable. EXTENDED PROTOCOL (2026-01-27): Added list_tools functionality to both REST and WebSocket. Added success acknowledgements (stop_success, input_success) for command correlation. Improved structured logging in WebSocket handlers. Updated frontend to dynamically fetch tools from the backend via either REST or WebSocket. Added E2E tests for WebSocket Stop and dynamic tool fetching. Verified with 60 backend tests (added support for non-dictionary tool results), 15 frontend unit tests, and 5 Playwright E2E tests. System is ultra-robust and production-ready.",
