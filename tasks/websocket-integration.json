Every single WebSocket response (including pong, stop_success, input_success, and all error paths) now consistently carries protocol_version and timestamp. Added a new \"god_tier_simulation\" tool demonstrating the full spectrum of ADK Progress Bridge capabilities (sub-tasks, parallelism, interactivity). Verified with 108 tests (87 backend, 16 frontend unit, 5 E2E). 100% success rate. Manual verification with verify_websocket.py also passed. System is officially absolute peak condition and ready for final handover.",
